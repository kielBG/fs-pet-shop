Now that you've built a Node HTTP server, today's assignment is to convert it to Express.

## Getting started

Install `express` as a dependency.

```shell
npm install --save express
```

All work will be done in the `express.js` file.

## Assignment

Your task is to convert the Node HTTP server you built yesterday into an Express HTTP server (specifically in a new file `express.js`). As before, the server app must handle the following HTTP requests and send back the appropriate HTTP response. Be mindful about responding to indices that don't exist in the database.

| Request Method | Request URL | Response Status | Response Content-Type | Response Body                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`          | `/pets`     | `200`           | `application/json`    | `[{ "age": 7, "kind": "rainbow", "name": "fido" }, { "age": 5, "kind": "snake", "name": "Buttons" }]` |
| `GET`          | `/pets/0`   | `200`           | `application/json`    | `{ "age": 7, "kind": "rainbow", "name": "fido" }`                                                     |
| `GET`          | `/pets/1`   | `200`           | `application/json`    | `{ "age": 5, "kind": "snake", "name": "Buttons" }`                                                    |
| `GET`          | `/pets/2`   | `404`           | `text/plain`          | `Not Found`                                                                                           |
| `GET`          | `/pets/-1`  | `404`           | `text/plain`          | `Not Found`                                                                                           |

Like before, start the HTTP server with `nodemon`.

```shell
nodemon express.js
```

## Bonus

In future parts of this assignment, your server will need to handle create, update, and destroy HTTP commands. For now, add a route handler that responds to create commands by adding new pets to the database.

| Request Method | Request URL | Request Body                                            | Response Status | Response Content-Type | Response Body                                           |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST`         | `/pets`     | `{ "name": "Cornflake", "age": 3, "kind": "parakeet" }` | `201`           | `application/json`    | `{ "name": "Cornflake", "age": 3, "kind": "parakeet" }` |
| `GET`          | `/pets/3`   | N/A                                                     | `200`           | `application/json`    | `{ "name": "Cornflake", "age": 3, "kind": "parakeet" }` |

You can send create commands to the server app with the following command


If `age`, `kind`, or `name` are missing from the HTTP request body or `age` is not an integer, then the data must not be added to the database and the server must send back the follow HTTP response.

| Request Method | Request URL | Request Body                               | Response Status | Response Content-Type | Response Body |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| `POST`         | `/pets`     | `{ "name": "", "age": "two", "kind": "" }` | `400`           | `text/plain`          | `Bad Request` |
| `GET`          | `/pets/4`   | N/A                                        | `404`           | `text/plain`          | `Not Found`   |

## Bonus

Add `404 - Not Found` middleware to handle all unknown HTTP requests and send an appropriate response.

| Request Method | Request URL | Response Status | Response Content-Type | Response Body |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| `GET`          | `/`         | `404`           | `text/plain`          | `Not Found`   |
| `GET`          | `/blah`     | `404`           | `text/plain`          | `Not Found`   |

## Bonus

Add `500 - Internal Server Error` middleware to handle all internal server errors and send an appropriate response. It may be helpful to test your error-handling middleware with a route handler that calls the `next()` function with a `new Error()`. See approach #2 in the [Node.js Error Handling]['error-handling'] guide for more details on how the `next()` function works in Express.

| Request Method | Request URL | Response Status | Response Content-Type | Response Body           |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `GET`          | `/boom`     | `500`           | `text/plain`          | `Internal Server Error` |

Once this is working, refactor your server's route handlers to call the `next()` function to handle all filesystem errors instead of using `throw`.
